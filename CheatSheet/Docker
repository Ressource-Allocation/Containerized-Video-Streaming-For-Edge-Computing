HOW DOES IT WORK (SIMPLIFIED)

- You build a docker image aka the configuration of your containers from which you will create your containers
- To each containers will be assigned a default name if not precised in parameters and an hexa ID
- Docker uses linux OS to work and give acces to resources to containers, if you use Docker Desktop app for Windows, it will install a linux distribution


COMMANDS

- To connect to your docker account: docker login
- To search for a container on the Docker Hub: docker search <name to search>
- To get a container from the Docker Hub: docker pull <name to pull>
- To run a container: docker run [options] <name of the image from which to run the container>
- To get access to a container's shell: docker exec <name of the container> /bin/bash
