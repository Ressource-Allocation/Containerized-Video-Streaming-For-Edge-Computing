This is our HLS server Dockerfile.
Our HLS server is based on an alpine distribution, on which we install nodejs, our video and linux tools (vim, curl, ffmpeg) and script.

The default exposed port is 8000.
Please feel free to use it.

If you need more information about Dockerfile, please read our CheatSheet.
